    <p>To make this authentic Mexican hot chocolate, you need Mexican hot chocolate tablets or squares which gives
    it its unique taste. Eat the chile only if you can handle it!</p>

    <strong>Ingredients</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
      <li>1/2 Mexican hot chocolate drink tablet (such as Nestle Abuelita)</li>
      <li>1 dried red chile de arbol, lightly toasted</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Directions</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Place Milk and Chocolate in a small saucepan over medium-low heat
      and simmmer, stirring, until chocolate is melted but not boiling, about 5 minutes</li>
      <li>Pour chocolate mixture into a blender. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; blend until foamy.
      Pour into a mug. Break the chile into 2 or 3 pieces, discarding seeds, and drop into the hot chocolate. Drink
      immediately.</li>
      <strong>Cook's Note:</strong>
      <p>To get the authentic taste, you need to use Mexican chocolate, which contains sugar and cinnamon. It gives
      the hot chocolate its specific taste. I prefer to use 4 little of Rey Margo(R) chocolate, but it's not as easy to find here. You can also use 1/2 tablet Abuelita(R) chocolate per serving</p>
    </ol>
